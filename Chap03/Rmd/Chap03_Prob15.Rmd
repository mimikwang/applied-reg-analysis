### Problem 15

For the data of Problem 14, suppose that a test of $H_0:\mu_1 = \mu_2$ versus $H_A:\mu_1 > \mu_2$ yielded a computed value of the appropriate test statistic equal to 2.55.

**a.** What conclusions should be drawn for $\alpha = .05$?

```{r}
t <- qt(0.95, df = 33, lower.tail = TRUE)
t
```

Since 2.55 > 1.69, we reject the null hypothesis.

**b.** What conclusions should be drawn for $\alpha = .01$?

```{r}
t <- qt(0.99, df = 33, lower.tail = TRUE)
t
```

Since 2.55 > 2.44, we reject the null hypothesis.
