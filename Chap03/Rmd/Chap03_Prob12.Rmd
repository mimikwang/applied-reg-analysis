### Problem 12

The limits of a 95% confidence interval for the mean $\mu$ of a normal population with unknown variance are found by adding to and subtracting from the sample mean a certain multiple of the estimated standard error of the sample mean.  If the sample size on which this confidence interval is based is 28, the *multiple* referred to in the previous sentence is the number ________.

```{r}
multiple <- qt(0.975, df = 28 - 1, lower.tail = TRUE)
multiple
```
