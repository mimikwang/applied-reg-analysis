### Problem 11

Suppose that the weight $W$ of male patients registered at a diet clinic has the normal distribution with mean 190 and variance 100.

**a.** For a random sample of patient of size $n = 25$, the expression $P(\overline{W} < 180)$ in which $\overline{W}$ denotes the sample mean weight, is equivalent to saying $P(Z > ?)$. [*Note:* $Z$ is a standard normal random variable.]

```{r}
z_score <- (190 - 180) / (sqrt(100) / sqrt(25))
z_score
```

**b.** Find an interval $(a, b)$ such that $P(a < \overline{W} < b) = .80$ for the same random sample in part (a).

```{r}
a <- qnorm(0.90, mean = 190, sd = sqrt(100) / sqrt(25), lower.tail = FALSE)
b <- qnorm(0.90, mean = 190, sd = sqrt(100) / sqrt(25), lower.tail = TRUE)

a; b
```
